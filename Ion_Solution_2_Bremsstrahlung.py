# ### Calculation of the intensity distribution

# The continuous spectral intensity distribution $I(\lambda)$ of Bremsstrahlung radiation produced by an electron hitting a solid target in an X-ray tube can be calculated using the following equation
# $$
#     I(\lambda) = K \big(\frac{\lambda}{\lambda_\mathrm{min}} - 1\big) \frac{1}{\lambda^3},
# $$
# 
# Since we want to calculate $I(\lambda)$ multiple times for different voltages, we will wrap the calculation in a function that takes a wavelength vector and a voltage as input and returns the intensity distribution $I(\lambda)$. In this function we also calculate the required $\lambda_{min}$ for the corresponding voltage from
# 
# $$
#     \lambda_\mathrm{min} = \frac{h \cdot c}{e \cdot U} = \frac{1.24\cdot10^{-6}\text{Vm}}{U\,[\text{V}]}.
# $$
# 
# To enter the values for the Planck constant $h$, the speed of light $c$, and electron charge $e$, we use of the submodule [constants](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/constants.html) from the ``scipy`` package. For example, to access $e$, we can simply write:

# In[2]:


print(constants.e)


# Finally, let's put together the function for calculating the Bremsstrahlung intensity distributions:

# In[3]:


def bremsstrahlung(wavelength, voltage):
    k = 1 # set the constant k to one
    
    # calculate lambda_min
    hce = constants.h * constants.c / constants.e # factor in lambda_min [Vm]
    lambda_min_m = hce / voltage # the result in meters
        
    # calculate I(lambda)
    I = k * (wavelength / lambda_min_m - 1) / wavelength**3
        
    # allow only for positive values in I 
    # by applying the elementwise maximum between I and 0
    I = np.maximum(I, 0)
        
    return I


# Please note that before returning the calculated $I(\lambda)$, we apply the ``np.maximum(I, 0)`` function to all elements to allow only positive values for I. This is because the equation for $\lambda < \lambda_{min}$ returns negative spectral intensities, which is physically impossible.

# ### Bremsstrahlung for multiple voltages

# Since we want to calculate $I(\lambda)$ for a continuous distribution of wavelengths, we first create a vector ranging from 0 to 5 Angstroms. We then covert the units of the wavelengths to meters as this is the unit expected in our ```bremsstrahlung``` function. Finally, we also create a vector containing the 4 voltages that will be used for plotting:

# In[4]:


lambda_angstrom = np.linspace(0, 5, 1000) # in Angstrom
lambda_m = lambda_angstrom * 1e-10 # convert to SI
u_v = np.array([20, 30, 40, 50]) * 1e3


# > You might be tempted to create a variable called ``lambda`` for the wavelength, but note that in python this is a keyword reserved to define an anonymous function, so you'll get an error, if you try to assign anything to it.
# 
# Finally, we calculate the spectral intensity distrubtions of the bremsstrahlung for all voltages and plot the result:

# In[5]:


# loop over all voltages
for voltage in u_v:
    spectrum = bremsstrahlung(lambda_m, voltage)        
    
    # plot over lambda in angstrom,
    # also add a label with the voltages in keV and
    # format without decimal signs (.0f)) 
    plt.plot(lambda_angstrom, spectrum, label=f"{voltage*1e-3:.0f}")
    
# format the plot
plt.xlabel(r"$\lambda$ [Ã…]")
plt.ylabel(r"$I(\lambda)$ [a.u.]")
plt.legend(title="$U_A$ [kV]")
plt.xlim(lambda_angstrom[0], lambda_angstrom[-1])
plt.grid(True, which='minor', linestyle='--', alpha=0.4)
